## Getting Started


### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Jeeevii/SecureAI.git
```

### 2. Run backend server

```sh
# Change directory to backend
cd backend/

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)

# Install required backend dependencies 
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the backend server
python server.py
```

### 3. Run frontend server

```sh
# Change directory to frontend
cd frontend/

# Install required frontend dependencies 
npm install

# Run the frontend server
npm run dev
```

### 4. View the application

- **Frontend URL:** http://localhost:3000
- **Backend URL:** http://localhost:8000

## Example Workflow
1. User inputs public GitHub repo URL.
2. Backend parses repo files.
3. Files are scanned in chunks by Gemini.
4. Vulnerabilities are detected and explained.
5. Malware scanning on binaries with MetaDefender.
6. Results are presented in a sleek, actionable dashboard.
7. Optionally export full report as a PDF.
