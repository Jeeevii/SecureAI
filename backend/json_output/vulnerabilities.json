Although the `table` argument is validated against a whitelist (`ALLOWED`), the `id` is directly incorporated into the query without proper sanitization. This could allow a malicious actor to bypass the whitelist check by manipulating the `id` argument to inject SQL commands, even if the `table` is a valid one. For example, an attacker could inject a subquery or additional SQL statements through the `id` parameter, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.",
