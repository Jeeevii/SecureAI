    "description": "The search function takes the user's input and directly inserts it into the page's HTML. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page, which would then be executed in the user's browser.",

Alternatively, sanitize the user's input before inserting it into the page to remove any potentially harmful code.",
